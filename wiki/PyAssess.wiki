    Warning: PyAssess is being rewritten as the Pyslet package, documented and distributed as part of the [Home QTI Migration Tool] project.  This information is largely of historic interest.

== History ==

The PyAssess project was started in 2005 with some funding from [http://www.jisc.ac.uk/ JISC] and was born out of the related QTI Migration Tool and some even earlier work in python created by Alice Still who was working as a programmer in the Interactive Technologies in Assessment and Learning Unit (ITAL) within UCLES (now [http://www.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/ Cambridge Assessment] ).

The current codebase was rewritten by Steve Lay while working at Cambridge Assessment and was also transferred to [http://www.caret.cam.ac.uk/ CARET] for a while.  Thanks are also due to Tom Pelly for his valiant attempts at getting it working with Jython!

== Outputs ==

PyAssess resulted in an open source python package providing a module for handling QTI-based content. It was primarily aimed at testing the specification and helping others to test their own implementations and content. The aim was also to provide a starting point for other python-based QTI projects of course.

The source code is available from the branches folder of this project's [http://code.google.com/p/qtimigration/source/checkout SVN repository].
