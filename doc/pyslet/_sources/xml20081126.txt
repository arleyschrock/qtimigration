XML: Basic Constructs
=====================

.. py:module:: pyslet.xml20081126

This module defines classes for working with XML documents.  The version of the
standard implemented is the Extensible Markup Language (Fifth Edition), for more
info see: http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/

XML is an integral part of many standards for LET but Pyslet takes a slightly
different approach from the pre-existing XML support in the Python language. XML
elements are represented by instances of a basic :class:`XMLElement` class which
can be used as a base class to customize document processing for specific types
of XML document.  It also allows these XML elements to 'come live' with
additional methods and behaviours.

This module also exposes a number of internal functions typically defined
privately in XML parser implementations which make it easier to reuse concepts
from XML in other modules. For example, the :func:`IsNameStartChar` tells you if
a character matches the production for NameStartChar in the XML standard.

..	autoclass:: XMLDocument
	:members:
	:show-inheritance:
