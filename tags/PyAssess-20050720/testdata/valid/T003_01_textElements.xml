        <p>[1:B] Look at the content and the formatting of the text in this item. Each part of the
            text is labelled with a number, in sequence, followed by one of the letters 'B' or 'I'
            which stand for 'block' or 'inline' respectively. A system fails if (a) any of the
            numbered parts are missing; (b) any block parts run in with the previous text; (c) any
            inline parts do not run in with the previous text; (d) any of the parts labelled as
            being distinguishable appear the same when rendered. </p>
        <p>[2:B] The following 6 headings should be distinguishable:</p>
        <h1>[3:B] h1 (Heading Level 1)</h1>
        <h2>[4:B] h2 (Heading Level 2)</h2>
        <h3>[5:B] h3 (Heading Level 3)</h3>
        <h4>[6:B] h4 (Heading Level 4)</h4>
        <h5>[7:B] h5 (Heading Level 5)</h5>
        <h6>[8:B] h6 (Heading Level 6)</h6>
        <p>[9:B] This paragraph contains inline parts that do not need to be distinguishable from
            this run of plain text: <abbr>[10:I] abbr (abbreviated form)</abbr>
            <acronym>[11:I] acronym (an acronym)</acronym>
            <cite>[12:I] cite (a citation or a reference to other sources)</cite>
            <dfn>[13:I] dfn (the defining instance of the enclosed term)</dfn>
            <span>[14:I] span (grouping element)</span>
        </p>
        <p>[15:B] This paragraph contains inline parts that should be distinguishable from plain
            text by the user: <code>[16:I] code (a fragment of computer code)</code>
            <kbd>[17:I] kbd (text to be entered by the user)</kbd>
            <samp>[18:I] samp (sample output from programs, scripts, etc.)</samp>
            <var>[19:I] var (an instance of a variable or program argument)</var>
        </p>
        <p>[20:B] This paragraph contains inline parts that must be distinguishable by the user:
                <em>[21:I] em (emphasis)</em>
            <strong>[22:I] strong (strong emphasis)</strong>
        </p>
        <address>[22:B] address (contact information for an item).</address>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/RED-html401-19991224">
            <p>[23:B] blockquote (quoted text). There is no specific requirement for rendering of
                blockquote text, except to note the following remark from the HTML 4.01
                specification.</p>
            <p>[24:B] We recommend that style sheet implementations provide a mechanism for
                inserting quotation marks before and after a quotation delimited by BLOCKQUOTE in a
                manner appropriate to the current language context and the degree of nesting of
                quotations. However, as some authors have used BLOCKQUOTE merely as a mechanism to
                indent text, in order to preserve the intention of the authors, user agents should
                not insert quotation marks in the default style.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>[25:B] The handling of quoted text requires particular attention, as per the folling
            note, which itself should appear with delimiting quotation marks: <q
                cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/RED-html401-19991224">[26:I] Visual user agents must
                ensure that the content of the Q element is rendered with delimiting quotation
                marks. Authors should not put quotation marks at the beginning and end of the
                content of a Q element.</q>
        </p>
        <div>[27:B] div (generic language/style container): although marked as a block element div
            is normally used to contain other block elements.</div>
        <pre><![CDATA[[28:B] pre (preformatted text)
The rendering should (where appropriate):
  (a) leave white space intact
  (b) render with a fixed-pitch font
  (c) disable automatic word wrapping]]></pre>
        <p/>
        <p>[29:B] This paragraph illustrates the use of forced line breaks, systems must start a new
            line as indicated at each [EOL]<br/> Line 1 [EOL]<br/> Line 2 [EOL]<br/> Line 3 [EOL]</p>
        <p>[30:B] This is the last paragraph.</p>
