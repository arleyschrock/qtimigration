PyAssess

This is the first public release of PyAssess, the main purpose of this
release is create a snapshot of the code as used at the CETIS/ELF
CodeBash, July 20th 2005 in Glasgow.

There is no documentation at the moment (though use of pydoc may tell
you some thing) and the code is very much work in progress.  However,
this release has a working set of tests that you can run by changing to
the top level PyAssess directory (the one containing this file) and
running the test.py command.

To install the PyAssess modules for use from your own scripts just run:

python setup.py install

Finally, the main thing to look at in this release is the growing
number of testdata files that are used to test the PyAssess modules
against.  These are all in the testdata directory.

The source for all the modules is in the PyAssess subdirectory, feel
free to browse around.
