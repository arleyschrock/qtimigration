OData Reference
===============

The basic API for the DAL is defined by the Entity Data Model
(EDM) defined in :py:mod:`pyslet.odata2.csdl`, which is extended by
some core OData-specific features defined in
:py:mod:`pyslet.odata2.core`.  With these two modules it is possible to
create derived classes that implement the API in a variety of different
storage scenarios.
