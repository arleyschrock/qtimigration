    <itemBody>
        <p>Look at the content and the formatting of the text in the following paragraph. Each part
            of the text is labelled with a number, in sequence. A system fails if (a) any of the
            numbered parts are missing; (b) a part does not run in with the previous text; (c) any
            part fails to be rendered in the way described (this is stricter than the requirement in
            HTML) or (d) there is no horizontal rule between this paragraph and the next. Non-visual
            systems, by definition, cannot support these elements.</p>
